# FriendFinder

Friend Finder hard to have been one of the most difficult assignments of this course.

Wrapping my head around the several different dependencies, POST, GET, and other requests, all while trying to make the final game logic work were very challenging but also extremely rewarding.

What I found helpful were the video tutorials and especially the Hot Restaurants. It gave me a very good understanding of how to lay out my server as well as connect to other folders in the page to handle things such as HTML and API routes.
